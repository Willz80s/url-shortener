# URL Shortener — Microservices

This repository contains three Node.js microservices for a URL shortener:
- api-service: create and fetch original URLs
- redirect-service: redirect short URLs and send analytics events
- analytics-service: collect click events and show basic stats

Run each service separately during development. We will containerize later.
